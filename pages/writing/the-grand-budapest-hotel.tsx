      <h2>A Quick Summary</h2>
      <p>
        With the help of his lobby boy, a philandering concierge steals a
        painting bequeathed to him by a wealthy hotel patron whom he is accused
        of murdering. On the run from both the patron’s family and the law, as
        well as a fascistic regime, Zero and Gustave must embark on a daring
        journey to clear the name of Monsieur Gustave H.
      </p>
      <h2>Reception at the Time</h2>
      <p>
        <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> was received positively by critics and
        audiences alike, many saying it was the ultimate culmination of what Wes
        Anderson had been working towards up until that point in his career.
        Critics noted its decadence and whimsy in contrast to the underlying
        dark themes. It was nominated for Best Picture and garnered the most
        Oscars during the 87th Academy Awards, tied with <i>Birdman</i>. It
        remains the only Wes Anderson film to win Oscars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Audiences rewarded it with the largest box office return for a Wes
        Anderson film to date, more than double any of his other films.
      </p>
      <h2>How It’s Aged</h2>
      <p>
        The hand-crafted quality of the film itself made it feel like a precious
        relic in 2014, and time has only strengthened that aesthetic. It
        reminded me of the still-delightful Monty Python animated sequences. The
        beautifully realized miniatures that serve as the zoomed-out setting for
        Zubrowka serve the double purpose of creating this aesthetic while
        masterfully portraying the geography we’re working within.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i> perfectly sums up Wes Anderson’s
        filmography up until 2014. All of his previous films come into play here
        in a way that seems to distill and perfect key aspects of each one, from{" "}
        <i>Bottle Rocket</i>
        with its bumbling criminals on the run to <i>Fantastic Mr. Fox</i> with
        its vibrant palette and intricate set designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of being a culmination of his work, it now serves as table
        setting for Wes Anderson’s films to come. The nesting doll structure
        that opens and closes this film eventually takes center stage in{" "}
        <i>Asteroid City</i> last year, and especially in his recent short, The
        Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. I believe these elements have only
        increased <i>Grand Budapest’s</i> standing as a film that balances where
        Wes was heading with a more standard storytelling structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of informing his own future work, you can feel the influence of
        this film on one filmmaker in particular: Paul King.{" "}
        <i>Paddington 2 (2017)</i> specifically calls back to this film with its
        prison break and love of pink.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I’d like to give a shout-out to Ralph Fiennes and his emergence
        as a comic genius in this film. His delivery is incredible, and I can’t
        help but link it to his more recent role in The Menu <i>(2022)</i>,
        which made me laugh out loud more than any other film that year.
      </p>
      <h2>Best Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Not to sound like a broken record, but Ralph Fiennes is the best part of
        this film. I read that this role was specifically written for him, and I
        can feel it. He embodies this unique character who himself embodies
        Anderson’s films as a whole: tidy and refined, yet an absolute mess
        inside. On top of all this, he embodies 1930s Europe with all the crisp,
        sharp uniforms spreading darkness across the land.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d also like to give a shout-out to a few standout sequences: the
        jailbreak, the museum chase, and the ski chase. Taken together, you get
        a good idea of the breadth of Anderson’s abilities. They are all of a
        piece in that they fit the aesthetic of the film, but are all
        interesting and fun in their own right.
      </p>
      <h2>Overall</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Grand Budapest</i> has grown in my esteem and has been my favorite of
        Anderson’s films for a few years now. To me, it’s infinitely rewatchable
        and is more fun with each viewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to focus on the surface, as I’ve mostly done in this review,
        but the underlying themes around fascism and immigration make it more
        relevant than ever and ultimately turn this from a sweet treat into a
        full meal.
