        In 2016, I had some{" "}
        <Link href="/writing/creating-lilt-part-4">big ideas</Link> that
        required developing Twitter bots and decided to build an ebooks account
        as a sort of trial run. It came together much faster than I&apos;d
        expected and I was able to switch to my other Twitter bot ideas within a
        few weeks.

        beyond the initial setup, it has been a constant presence in my online
        life since. People still find joy and entertainment from its tweets and
        frequently play along with their weird responses.

        Even the quirks caused by &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; were fun, such as when it
        would repeat my tweets verbatim. Here, the bot turned one of my tweets
        into a sort of ouroboros.
