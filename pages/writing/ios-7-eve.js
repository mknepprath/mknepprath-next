    <p>
      Apple is releasing iOS 7 to the public tomorrow, and I couldn’t be more
      excited! In case you haven’t heard, Apple has redesigned their entire
      mobile operating system from the ground up. Every single pixel has
      changed. They’ve been tweaking and perfecting it since it’s big reveal at
      WWDC earlier this year… and the day has finally come for me to try it out
      for myself. One thing I find particularly interesting about this update is
      how much it reveals{" "}
      <a href="https://tapfame.com/ios7/">
        the use of Apple’s default chrome in third party apps
      </a>
      . This is the biggest change to iOS since the first iPhone came out, and I
      welcome it.
