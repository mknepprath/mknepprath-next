        them. Yay!

      <h2>2019 Goals</h2>
      <h3>Get a new job âœ…</h3>
      <p>
        This was a goal that had rolled over from 2018. With my wife starting
        medical school soon (a.k.a. this year), I was hoping to find a more
        remote-friendly company. I wanted to be free to easily move to wherever
        her school of choice would be. In February, I landed an interview at
        Walmart Labs and got a position on my first fully-remote team. I&apos;m
        less than a year in, but enjoying it!
      </p>
      <h3>Read books âœ…</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been having a hard time reading books since college despite
        being an avid reader growing up. Notable books I read this year:

      </ul>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been averaging less than 10 books a year, which is... not
        great. But I&apos;m glad it&apos;s not nothing.
      </p>
      <h3>Blog âœ…</h3>
      <p>
        My website included a link to Medium in lieu of a blog from ~2015 until
        recently.{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/mknepprath/mknepprath-next/pull/10/files">
          That changed this year
        </a>{" "}
        for a few reasons. First, developing a blog from scratch seemed like a
        fun project. Second, Medium had become pretty aggressive with paywalls,
        etc, and I wanted to feel like I had ownership over my writing again.
        Finally, I hoped that doing this work would motivate me to do more
        writing - my Medium profile had become stagnant. This appears to be have
        been successful, since I didn&apos;t write any posts last year and wrote
        5 this year:
      </p>

        </li>
        <li>2019 in Review (this post)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bonus: I hunted down old posts from previous iterations of my website
        using the Wayback Machine and <a href="/writing">included them here</a>{" "}
        as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Quit Facebook ðŸŸ¡</h3>
      <p>
        While I didn&apos;t use Facebook all year, I still have an account.
        It&apos;s currently deactivated, but I can&apos;t consider this a
        success until it&apos;s gone... permanently.
      </p>
      <h3>Develop an iOS app ðŸ”´</h3>
      <p>
        I had hoped to complete an iOS app I&apos;d started working on in 2018
        for tracking movies. I learned a lot, but it ended up being a bigger
        undertaking than I&apos;d anticipated and I was no longer able to
        dedicate the time required to push it out. I released a working,
        unpolished beta to TestFlight, but that&apos;s as far as it got.
      </p>
      <h3>Illustrate âœ…</h3>
      <p>
        I have an art/graphic design college degree, which means I feel
        unfulfilled if I don&apos;t illustrate <em>something</em> each year.
        This year I illustrated a few moths and posted them to{" "}

      <h2>Cool Things</h2>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>
        On top of starting a new job, moving to a new state, and changing nearly
        everything else in our lives, I also traveled more than ever before.
        According to <a href="https://www.flightyapp.com/">Flighty</a>, I flew
        the equivalent of .9x around the earth this year alone.

      <p>Some highlights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>January, Imaging USA with White House Custom Colour</li>
        <li>March, Disneyland with my family</li>
        <li>April, Walmart Labs meetup in Carlsbad, CA</li>
        <li>September, another Walmart Labs meetup in SLC</li>
        <li>October, React Conf</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Attended a local meetup</h3>
      <p>
        This wasn&apos;t available where I lived in Minnesota. It&apos;s been
        very cool to attend a React meetup in Cleveland with developers of
        varying levels of experience. I&apos;ve met new friends and learned a
        lot from the few I&apos;ve attended already. I look forward to
        continuing this in 2020.
      </p>
      <h3>Twitter bots</h3>
      <p>
        I don&apos;t have much to show for it, but I worked on my Twitter bots
        quite a bit. <a href="https://twitter.com/FamiliarLilt">Lilt</a> was
        almost{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/mknepprath/lilt/commit/285034e77ef43505c119f6f459c87695eff51719">
          entirely rewritten
        </a>{" "}
        and the game itself has been expanded. I hope to do more before formally
        announcing it, however.

      <h2>2020 Goals</h2>
      <p>
        For the first time ever, here&apos;s my list of what I&apos;d like to
        accomplish during the next year.
      </p>
      <h3>Read 10 books</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve been averaging less than 10 books per year. If I can make it
        to 10, I&apos;ll be happy.
      </p>
      <h3>Write 10 blog posts</h3>
      <p>
        I added this blog to my website in August and averaged one post per
        month. This should be achievable.
      </p>
      <h3>Release the next chapter of Lilt</h3>
      <p>
        I have a couple goals for{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/familiarlilt">Lilt</a>. First, I hope to
        develop a user interface to help manage moves, locations, and items in
        the game (likely with React). Second, I want to introduce more areas to
        explore. While the interface would be nice for me, it doesn&apos;t add
        anything of interest for Lilt&apos;s players. This is why I want to
        focus on expanding the game first.
      </p>
      <h3>Complete 3 online courses</h3>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve purchased a bunch of online courses over the years that
        I&apos;d like to finish. I hope to finish at least three of these during
        2020:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.3dfordesigners.com/">3D for Designers</a> by
          Devon Ko
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://testingjavascript.com/">Testing JavaScript</a> with
          Kent C. Dodds
        </li>
        <li>5 courses on Udemy (Swift, React, Python, TensorFlow...)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Draw, illustrate, animate!</h3>
      <p>
        I want to draw some more comics, create some short animations, etc. I
        don&apos;t care all that much about the format as long as I do some cool
        visual work. I may even dabble in capital &lquo;A&rquo; Art again.
      </p>
      <h2>Tracking My Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I haven&apos;t decided how I&apos;d like to track all of this yet.
        I&apos;m leaning towards posting a bimonthly update to my blog. That
        would count towards my blogging goal, right??
