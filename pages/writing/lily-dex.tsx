        Despite being a lifelong fan of Pokémon, I hadn&apos;t played any of the
        games since FireRed... that is, until the release of Pokémon Go in 2016.
        My family had a ton of fun hunting around downtown running into other
        families excitedly playing the game - it was an amazing and novel
        experience no app or game has been able to replicate since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, we moved to Ohio, and Go has continued to be a fun way to
        stay connected with family and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the primary goals of the Pokémon franchise is completing your
        Pokédex by{" "}

          catching &apos;em all
        </a>
        , and Go is no different. For a while, I maintained a{" "}

          Notion

        document with a list of Pokémon I was missing along with an icon hinting
        at how to catch them. It was a bit of a pain to keep it updated,
        however. It was a manual process and frequently became outdated. I
        decided to turn this project into my first serious iOS app - maybe I
        could help others while automating this for myself!
      </p>
      <p>My two guiding principles while building this app were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>It must be entirely dedicated to Pokémon Go.</b> There are A LOT of
          Pokédexes in the App Store, most of which are more general-purpose and
          not focused on any particular game. Since I specifically want to know
          which Pokémon I&apos;m missing in Go, this is not useful.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>It must be simple.</b> The only number I care about is the total
          number of unique Pokémon I&apos;ve caught. For those who want to track
          more than this, like shiny Pokémon, regional variants, or costumed
          Pokémon, there{" "}

          >
            are existing apps
          </a>
          . This principle affects both content and interactivity: marking a
          Pokémon as caught is (and will always be) a one-tap action.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I started working on the app towards the end of July in parallel with{" "}

        >
          100 Days of SwiftUI
        </a>
        . Once I&apos;d replicated my Notion document as an app, I started
        adding new features: integration with{" "}
        <a href="https://pogoapi.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
          The PoGo API
        </a>{" "}
        to keep the Pokémon list up-to-date, a widget for displaying your dex
        total on your home screen, sorting options, current raid bosses, and
        more.

      />
      <p>
        If you search &ldquo;Pokédex&rdquo; in the App Store, you&apos;ll see a
        lot of sameness - most apps try to replicate the look of the Pokédex
        device you see in the show and games. To stand out a bit, I went with
        &ldquo;lily dex&rdquo; and leaned into{" "}

        as a design motif. Amazingly, my App Store reviewer recognized my{" "}

        </a>{" "}
        for what it was, and I had to modify it to make it a bit more generic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m proud of the fact that this app is already at a place where
        it&apos;s useful for me. It&apos;s also the first app I&apos;ve built
        that has been approved by Apple and published to the App Store! 🥳
