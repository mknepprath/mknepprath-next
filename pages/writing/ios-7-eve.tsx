        Apple is releasing iOS 7 to the public tomorrow, and I couldn’t be more
        excited! In case you haven’t heard, Apple has redesigned their entire
        mobile operating system from the ground up. Every single pixel has
        changed. They’ve been tweaking and perfecting it since it’s big reveal
        at WWDC earlier this year… and the day has finally come for me to try it
        out for myself. One thing I find particularly interesting about this
        update is how much it reveals{" "}
        <a href="https://tapfame.com/ios7/">
          the use of Apple’s default chrome in third party apps
        </a>
        . This is the biggest change to iOS since the first iPhone came out, and
        I welcome it.

          Remember when I told Apple to get rid of their horrendous highlights?
