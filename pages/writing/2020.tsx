        Hello and welcome to my second annual year-in-review post, the first
        being last year&apos;s <Link href="/writing/2019">2019 in Review</Link>.
        Unlike 2019, I had actual goals this year - so I can give a report on
        how I did. Yay!

        I&apos;m currently rereading Watchmen after watching the phenomenal HBO

      <h3>Release the next chapter of lilt ‚úÖ</h3>
      <p>
        I had big dreams for lilt that weren&apos;t realized this year.
        Regardless, I did add a few new areas to the game and announced it on
        Twitter, completing this goal.

      <h3>Complete 3 online courses üî¥</h3>
      <p>
        I made some progress on{" "}
        <A href="https://testingjavascript.com/">Testing JavaScript</A> by Kent
        C. Dodds and made it most of the way through{" "}
        <A href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">
          100 Days of SwiftUI
        </A>{" "}
        by Paul Hudson. I learned A LOT this year, yet I didn&apos;t complete a
        single course. This was the only 2020 goal I failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;d be easy for me to say, well, this was an unrealistic goal. It
        doesn&apos;t reflect how I actually learn. So it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;d be easy. And while I do believe it&apos;s true, I don&apos;t
        want to jump ahead without pointing out the fact that I clearly
        didn&apos;t understand something about myself at the time of goal
        setting and will take this into consideration when setting goals for
        2021.
      </p>
      <h3>Draw, illustrate, animate! ‚úÖ</h3>
      <p>
        I managed to create several drawings and animations during the first
        half of this year as outlined in{" "}
        <Link href="/writing/2020-mid-year-review#draw-illustrate-animate">
          my mid-year review
        </Link>
        . Since then, I made another movie with my son called{" "}
        <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdGTbURZhZc">Bag Crush</A>,
        more drawings, and started working on some 2D animations.

      </A>
      <p>
        A few of my drawings were enhanced by a collection of Copic markers I
        recently purchased, including the illustration for my most recent blog
        post, <Link href="/writing/ebooks">‚ÄúIt&apos;s Just the Algorithm‚Äù</Link>
        .
      </p>
      <h3>Bonus: Develop an iOS app ‚úÖ</h3>
      <p>
        One of my 2019 goals was to build an app. I spent quite a bit of time on
        this but ended up failing to accomplish this goal. In hindsight, I feel
        that the main reason was my lack of Swift experience and the rush to
        build something before picking up even the basics of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn&apos;t set a repeat goal for this in 2020, and yet...{" "}
        <Link href="/writing/lily-dex">I built an app</Link>! And{" "}
        <A href="https://lilydex.com">
          <em>published</em> it
        </A>
        ! This was all thanks to the excellent 100 Days of SwiftUI course
        mentioned above. I didn&apos;t complete the course, yet I was able to do
        more with the knowledge I gained from it than I would&apos;ve ever
        imagined at the beginning of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to give some credit to Apple, as well. SwiftUI wasn&apos;t around
        for my previous attempts at iOS development, and it was a joy to work
        with.

      <h2>Cool Things</h2>
      <h3>Side projects</h3>
      <p>
        I worked on a lot of web-based side projects outside of my goals
        outlined at the beginning of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I dropped all of my other projects to work on the{" "}
        <A href="https://culturallyirrelevant.com">
          Culturally Irrelevant Recommendation Board
        </A>
        , a website inspired by a retired podcast of the same name. I spent a
        full month on this site and described the process in a post entitled{" "}
        <Link href="/writing/culturally-irrelevant">
          Building a Culturally Irrelevant Recommendation Board
        </Link>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        I also worked on a game. I gave it a name,{" "}
        <A href="http://tinymystery.club">Tiny Mystery Club</A>, and added some
        actual gameplay elements. I think it will be an interesting sandbox to
        play in next year.
      </p>
      <Image
        alt="Tiny Mystery Club"
        className="corner-radius-8"

        layout="responsive"
        priority
        width={600}
      />
      <p>
        Finally, I did a bunch of work on my personal site, including
        integrating Goodreads and Letterboxd into my{" "}
        <Link href="/about">About</Link> page to display six of my most recently
        read books and watched movies. Behind the scenes, I added a bunch of{" "}
        <A href="https://www.cypress.io">Cypress</A> tests and used{" "}
        <A href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</A> to
        automatically run them on all of my commits.
      </p>

        width={1242}
      />
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, my family moved to a new state. For the first time in years,
        I thought about doing some online gaming since it&apos;s a fun way to
        socialize with the friends I wasn&apos;t able to see as much anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&apos;ve been playing about once a week and it&apos;s been a blast.
        Early on we played Hammerwatch, then Unrailed! (which has an amazing
        soundtrack), some Tabletop Simulator, and tons of Among Us.{" "}
      </p>
      <Image

      />
      <h2>2021 Goals</h2>
      <p>Time to up the stakes. Here are my revised goals for 2021.</p>
      <h3>Read 15 books</h3>
      <p>
        Last year, I said I&apos;d be happy if I read ten books. Since I
        surpassed that goal by quite a bit, I&apos;m going to increase this goal
        to 15. My only hesitation here is that I&apos;d like the flexibility to
        read some larger books such as Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson.
        We&apos;ll see how it goes.
      </p>
      <h3>Write 10 blog posts</h3>
      <p>
        I think 10 posts a year is a pretty good cadence and I&apos;d like to
        continue with it. My main hope is that these goals drive me to be
        consistent, so they don&apos;t necessarily have to increase in
        difficulty.
      </p>
      <h3>Release the next version of Tiny Mystery Club</h3>
      <p>
        I believe <A href="https://tinymystery.club">Tiny Mystery Club</A> has a
        lot of potential, but I haven&apos;t spent anywhere near as much time as
        I would like developing it. Next year, I&apos;d like to develop a{" "}
        <em>good</em> mystery and release it as a big 2.0 release of the game.
      </p>
      <h3>Develop a collection of 2D animations</h3>
      <p>
        Hand-drawn 2D animations, that is. I&apos;ve{" "}
        <A href="https://vimeo.com/15226579">dabbled</A> with it in the past, so
        I know it&apos;s fun! The result of this goal should be a collection of
        thematically connected, consistent hand-drawn 2D animations.
      </p>
      <h3>Illustrate a comic</h3>
      <p>
        I sorta gave myself an out this year by grouping drawing, comics, and
        animation into one goal. Next year, I&apos;m GOING to MAKE a COMIC. That
        is all I know at this point.
      </p>
      <h3>Launch lily dex</h3>
      <p>
        I published lily dex, but I haven&apos;t formally announced it anywhere
        beyond Twitter. I&apos;d like to finish any lingering features on my
        to-do list, then make an actual effort to get customers. I also
        purchased the <A href="http://lilydex.com">lilydex.com</A> domain, so
        I&apos;m considering building out a lily dex web app, as well...

      <h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        2020 was my first year publicly setting goals, so it was far from
        guaranteed that I&apos;d be continuing it in 2021. It did cause me some
        stress, especially when I realized there was no way I&apos;d be
        completing three courses by the end of the year. I think it was worth
        it, though. I always had something to work on and all of it was
        rewarding, fun, or both.
