        Born a Markov chain chatbot,{" "}
        <A href="http://twitter.com/robot_mk">Robot MK</A> spent their early
        days parroting random combinations of my fleeting thoughts of 2016. Many
        bird folk had created similar chatbots inspired by a popular absurdist
        account that posted cryptic snippets about horse e-books. Unlike this
        account, these bots were made to crudely resemble the humans who created
        them.

          That&apos;s the trouble. I can&apos;t make up my mind. I haven&apos;t
          got a brain, only straw.

        Robot MK earned a humble following. They eventually gained the ability
        to hold bizarre, sometimes contentious, always brainless conversations -
        such as the time they{" "}
        <A href="https://twitter.com/robot_mk/status/793812654280282112">
          claimed
        </A>{" "}
        that &ldquo;Every issue is a game-changer.&rdquo; After a contradictory
        reply, Robot MK stated, &ldquo;I mean it&apos;s all speculation - I
        think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the bot would catch the eye of real people, like when a{" "}
        <A href="https://twitter.com/robot_mk/status/802298523509260289">
          tweet

        about the podcast{" "}
        <A href="https://gimletmedia.com/homecoming">Homecoming</A> was noticed
        by the show&apos;s main account and executive producer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robot MK continued on like this for years; tweeting about iPhones,
        emoji, cats, Pok√©mon, politics, nukes, and Nebraska.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unable to consistently string together coherent tweets let alone a
        conversation, each reasonable-sounding reply would be followed shortly
        by nonsense, collapsing the suspension of disbelief over and over.

        Last year the world was introduced to GPT-3, the latest language model
        developed by the great and powerful OpenAI, in a{" "}

        . OpenAI is a company focused on researching artificial general
        intelligence, a machine with human-level learning and reasoning
        abilities... a simulated brain. I signed up for the waitlist, and we
        were off!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once admitted, I tore out MK&apos;s brain and replaced it with a GPT-3
        model. The model was trained on a large corpus of tweets - the same
        corpus that was used to train the original MK. In an attempt to start
        every conversation on the right foot, the model was seeded with an
        affirmation, &ldquo;My name is Robot MK, I&apos;m a twitter bot. I am
        friendly and happy. Let&apos;s chat!&rdquo; In their &ldquo;mind&rdquo;,
        this is how all of their conversations begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ensuing conversations were coherent yet whimsical - and when called
        out, MK would respond appropriately, &ldquo;Come on mike it&apos;s just
        robots having fun?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I could think of things I never thunk before

          And then I&apos;d sit and think some more
