        I once had a co-worker tell me that using Apple Pay could only be
        attributed to laziness. They’d say, “what, is pulling out your card and
        swiping it so hard?” My answer would be no, and certainly not compared
        to past systems that would involve pulling out and counting cash
        manually, or even farther back when we’d be bartering furs for food. But
        at what point did we decide credit cards were good enough? Or any of the
        other systems we’ve put in placed,{" "}
        <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_fadell_the_first_secret_of_design_is_noticing">
          such as putting bar codes on fruit
        </a>
        ?

        My math will be very rough here as this is just for the sake of example,
        but let’s say a normal checkout experience takes 60 seconds and checkout
        with Apple Pay takes 45. If I live til I’m 80 making at least 2
        purchases a day, that adds up to nearly a full week (two, if you account
        for the fact that I’d still want to sleep at night). Now multiply that
        by every other task that could potentially be sped up by 15 seconds, or
        significantly more.

        In brief, time is one of our most limited resources, and I’d rather not
        spend even a few days of it doing a repetitive, meaningless task.
