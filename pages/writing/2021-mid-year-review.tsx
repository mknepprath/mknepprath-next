      <h2 id="read-15-books">Read 15 books (10/15)</h2>
      <p>
        My goal last year was 10 books, a total I&apos;ve already surpassed this
        time around. I was right to increase my goal to 15! What I&apos;ve read
        so far:

        Last year, I&apos;d written most of my blog posts during the first half
        of the year, got burned out, and wrapped up the rest near the end of the
        year. This time around, I&apos;m pacing myself.

        This project is in the research phase - I read a collection of short
        mystery stories, Serpents of Eden, along with The Long Halloween and
        Watchmen. <Link href="/writing/sherlock-codes">10x Detective</Link> came
        out of the research material for this project while I was looking into
        existing mystery game mechanics. More recently, I watched Sherlock Jr.,
        the 1924 Buster Keaton film.

          <b>PokÃ©mon Omega Ruby</b>: I finally got back around to playing Ruby

        At this point, I&apos;m not 100% confident that I&apos;ll complete all
        of my goals for this year. What I&apos;m discovering is that as I get
        access to new tools, I get sidelined by working on projects related to
        those things. I wonder if I should fight this instinct or design goals
        that are more flexible to accommodate for this. ðŸ¤”
