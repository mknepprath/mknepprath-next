        I’m not even halfway through the{" "}

          latest episode of Vector

        , but there have been so many great quotes about topics that have been
        on my mind lately, I had to write a quick post about it.{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie">Rene Ritchie</a> asks:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “When should you give users settings and choices and options, and when
          should you do that heavy lifting for them?”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Straightforward question – and the answer was obvious to me up through a
        couple years ago. We should be given as many settings, choices, and
        options as possible so we can optimize our experience to fit our every
        want or need.

        I’ve changed my mind, however. Here is the candid response I gave to my
        brother when he recently asked, “Why do artists use Macs?”:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “PCs are for people who want to have a computer and do computery
          things – experiment with them, customize them, optimize them, etc –
          and that’s fine. The Mac is more for people who want a computer for
          getting stuff done rather than have to deal with anything related to
          the computer itself.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>

        <a href="https://twitter.com/dwiskus">Dave Wiskus</a> shared similar
        thoughts with Rene in response to his question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “I lost so many years getting the software to work that I could’ve
          spent learning the software. If I had spent that same amount of time
          in front of a Mac learning Photoshop, I would’ve been years ahead of
          where I am now. That’s time that I, and so many other people, have
          lost. And so now I feel that my job in designing a piece of software
          is to not steal that time from people. I want to make sure they’re not
          wasting their time trying to figure out how the app works, and instead
          writing their note, and then moving on.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>

        In essence, a designer’s job is to reduce the friction between a person
        and their goal, whether that be creating a design, jotting down a note,
        sharing a photo – basically anything. The fewer steps there are between
        a person wanting to do something and achieving it – the better the
        design.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The apps that I like the most are the ones that don’t let me mess
          around – they basically force me into doing what I’m supposed to do.
          In a way, it’s sort of enabling. Yes, I can’t customize the way I
          want. That is a loss, but the gain is so much more valuable.”
