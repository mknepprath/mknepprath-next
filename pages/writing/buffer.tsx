        I ran into a problem recently. I would read a bunch of posts and share
        them all on Twitter right away. My followers would get inundated with
        updates, and usually not at a time that was ideal for them. How was I to
        continue sharing all of my discoveries without losing all of my
        followers?

      <p>
        <a href="http://bufferapp.com/r/507fd">Buffer</a> had the answer.

        Buffer allows you to create a schedule for your tweets, spreading them
        out so that your posts are consistent, but not overwhelming. Here’s how
        to make the most of Buffer:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>
            Install the{" "}
            <a href="http://bufferapp.com/extras">Buffer extensions and apps</a>
            .
          </b>{" "}
          You need these if you want to take full advantage of Buffer. I use the
          Chrome extension, which puts Buffer at the top of the browser at all
          times, and also integrates a Buffer button into Twitter, Facebook,
          Reddit, and many more websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Keep your Buffer queue full.</b> Whenever you find anything you
          want to tweet, click Buffer. A window will open where you can tweak
          the post that is automatically generated. Once you’ve perfected the
          post, click Add to Buffer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reorder tweets & tweak settings.</b> When you visit Buffer’s
          website, you will be taken to your dashboard. Here you are able to see
          all of your tweets and what times they are scheduled to go live.
          You’re able to switch the order, edit the posts, and edit the default
          schedule. As you use Buffer more, you’ll begin to discover which times
          are the most effective and which ones may need to be changed. The
          default schedule was calculated to be the most ideal for everyone, not
          necessarily for your audience.
        </li>
      </ol>

        If you plan on using this tool, I recommend that you{" "}

        This will give us both a referral bonus of one extra space in our
        queues.

        What tools do you currently use to manage your tweets, if any? I’d love
        to hear about them and try them out!
