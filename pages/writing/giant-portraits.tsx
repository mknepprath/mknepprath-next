        Upon deciding to take full advantage of my school’s unlimited black &
        white printing, I first blew up a photo by{" "}

        to <b>10 feet wide by 6.5 feet tall</b>, then pulled it into Photoshop
        and divided it into 8.5×11” sections. This first project ended up being
        95 sheets of printer paper that I displayed in my dorm room at the time.

        Above: Seniors Brandon Carr and Michael Knepprath pose next to their
        piece entitled &ldquo;The Couch.&rdquo; Knepprath remarked, &ldquo;It
        received quite a bit of positive feedback at the show, including the
        janitor telling me how much he loved the couch because it reminded him
        of the 70s. The piece is ultimately a memorial to this couch. We had to
        throw it away due to how nasty and smelly it was!&rdquo; Sophomore
        Tracey Melhouse praised Carr and Knepprath&apos;s creativity saying,
        &ldquo;I love this mural because it is so them; they captured themselves
        well.&rdquo;

        Unfortunately, the black & white yearbook photo doesn&apos;t do it
        justice here. My school gave each student a limited number of color
        prints, so I thought it&apos;d be clever to only use color in certain
        tiles and print the rest in black & white.

        For the end-of-year student art show I decided to go even bigger. I
        illustrated a portrait of myself and followed the same process, except
        this time the piece ended up being 323 sheets of paper, or{" "}
