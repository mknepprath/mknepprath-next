        I’d like to preface this post by saying everything being proposed here
        is entirely speculation and may never see the light of day. Speculation
        is fun, though – so let’s get into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumors of an Apple iWatch have been making the rounds for quite some
        time now. I’d normally brush these aside due to lack of evidence, but a
        few recent events have brought me back around to the idea.

          <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/23/4258272/apple-tim-cook-teases-exciting-new-product-category">
            Tim Cook has teased the possibility of new product categories this
            fall.

          This, in it of itself, does not imply a wearable is on the way. He
          could be referring to the rumored bigger iPhone. Or anything else,
          really.

            Screenshots of a Healthbook app have leaked.

          Again, this does not necessarily prove the existence of a wearable.
          The iPhone is{" "}

            Nike has all but abolished it’s FuelBand hardware team, and plans to
            focus on software.
          </a>{" "}
          Nike and Apple have always been very close. Nike isn’t a hardware
          company. Apple is. I think this is the biggest sign of what’s to come.
          My guess is that Apple and Nike have been working together on a
          product being designed and developed by Apple that will integrate with
          Nike+ (among many other things). I wouldn’t be surprised if we see
          this product being sold in Apple <em>and</em> Nike stores upon its
          release.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Clearly, this product will not ever be the cash cow that the iPhone
        ended up being. I think Apple is okay with that. For one, it will
        strengthen Apple’s current ecosystem of services and products. Second,
        assuming it’s a well designed and useful product, it will help people
        get and stay healthy. Apple may be willing to “take the hit” for the
        common good, as illustrated by Tim Cook’s retort to a conservative
        finance group who wanted him to commit to only doing things that were
        profitable in regard to Apple’s energy sustainability programs, “When we
        work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don’t consider the
        bloody ROI.”
