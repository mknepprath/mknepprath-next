        You were going to hear about{" "}
        <a href="https://leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> sooner or later, so it
        might as well be now. Leap Motion is a touch-free, 3D motion technology
        that is slated for release early this year.
      </p>

        And apparently it will only cost $75. Leap Motion is basically a Kinect
        with pinpoint precision that hooks up to your computer. What’s so
        amazing about this?

        1. You can “physically” interact with objects on your computer screen.
        The best example I’ve found of this can be seen in the video below.

          width="580"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        2. You can create artwork in 2D or 3D with no extra peripherals. In some
        of the demo videos, they actually use a pencil as a stylus and the Leap
        Motion was able to recognize it as a writing tool.

          height="326"
          width="580"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        3. It’s backwards compatible with touch screen applications, so it
        already works with a ton of different programs. One example is the
        ability to scroll down a web page simply by swiping it up with a finger.

        I’m very excited about having a new way to interact with my iMac and
        finally{" "}
