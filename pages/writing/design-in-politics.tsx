        How old are you? What was the first election you could vote in? Who was
        running? What do you remember about it?
      </p>
      <p>
        My first election was 2008; the election that swept the country by
        storm. A handsome, charismatic, charming junior senator from Illinois
        was up against, well, a crusty old dude. That’s how a lot of people
        viewed it anyway.
        <span id="more-596" />
      </p>
      <p>
        But there were other forces at work that edified this idea, it wasn’t
        just the fact that Senator McCain was old, but the way he managed his
        image and brand and he had to compete against the awesome design of the
        Obama campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Branding and design laws that are present in the market are also present
        in politics. We live in a world where you absolutely have to have a
        brand, a logo, and an overall identity and politicians are starting to
        take this seriously, something they hadn’t done in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google any campaign bumper stickers, posters, buttons or any type of
        campaign anything before this election. Go to the 70’s and 80’s and
        you’ll notice a very obvious lack of design. This is <em>mainly</em> due
        to the lack of digital art tools. There was no Illustrator and Photoshop
        back then, it was all handmade and printed on rolls. &nbsp;Even up into
        the 90’s everybody did red white and blue and some kind of flag, making
        for a less than memorable campaign, design-wise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let’s go to 4 years ago, Obama v. McCain. In the one corner, we have
        Obama, who gives us the “O.” That red white and blue O with hints of the
        flag and the suggestion of a horizon. Easily recognizable, easily
        incorporated into campaign paraphernalia, but most importantly, clean,
        sleek and modern. In the other corner you have McCain who gives us…his
        name… Most of his signs and bumper stickers just say “McCain Palin”. We
        obviously know which one has more impact and which one is better. Even
        if you don’t agree with Obama, you know it’s a great logo and it’s an
        awesome example of effective design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This “O” is a rallying point. To Obama supporters it was their Christian
        Fish or Cross, their Swastika, their Sickle and Hammer. (I am not trying
        to make a political statement with those allusions, but they are
        arguably the most famous socio-political logos in history.) Obama
        supporters also had the “Hope” image; kids hung it on their wall right
        next to their favorite movie posters because it was that good to look
        at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether we know it or not, we judge things by design. When you walk into
        a janky restaurant that isn’t very clean or looks really dated, isn’t it
        easier to speculate that the food cooked in back might be kind of gross?
        When I want to check on an organization or business I’ve never heard of,
        I go to their website. If it’s overrun with bad design and hard to
        navigate, my perception of the company isn’t good and I question the
        legitimacy of their operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>When we see bad design we tend to see them as less credible and</b>{" "}
        <b>
          the same is true with politics whether we are aware of it or not.
          &nbsp;
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent a lot of time talking about Obama and how good his campaign
        design looks, but what about the Republicans/Romney?&nbsp; The fact of
        the matter is that good design usually goes hand-in-hand with Democrats
        and issues supported by Democrats, so there’s more to analyze about
        Obama’s campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you’re not artistic, you can still recognize good and bad
        design, it’s essentially called Semiotics or the study of symbols and
        their meaning. We’re hard-wired to trust things that look good and doubt
        things that look shady or bad. Haunted mansions rarely look clean and
        beautiful, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately the issues will overcome design. People vote for whomever
        based on a variety of reasons and design usually isn’t one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          However, good design makes you want to share it and that is the
          ultimate goal of any institution that is convicted by its cause;
          sharing the message.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Good design might win over that person on the fence or that person who
        could care less. So whether you notice it or not, good design does
        impacts politics.
