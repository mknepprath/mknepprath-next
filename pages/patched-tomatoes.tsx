          is a Chrome extension that replaces the Tomatometer score on Rotten
          Tomatoes with the Critics&apos; Average Rating. It does the same for
          the Audience Score. I believe the Tomatometer score is calculated in a
          misleading way, and this extension aims to fix that.

          Let&apos;s create some films for the sake of example. Each film
          received 5 critic reviews. Here they are:

        <p>
          Upon reviewing these ratings - one might assume that Prime Directive
          is amazing, Blue Harvest is bad, and the remaining two films are
          similarly mediocre. What would Rotten Tomatoes say? Here&apos;s{" "}
          <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about">their definition</a> of
          a “Fresh” film:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The Tomatometer score represents the percentage of professional critic
          reviews that are positive for a given film or television show... When
          at least 60% of reviews for a movie or TV show are positive, a red
          tomato is displayed to indicate its Fresh status.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          What does this mean for our example films? First, we need to convert
          each critic rating to a binary “positive” or “not positive” review. In
          most cases, Rotten Tomatoes considers 5.5/10 and above a “positive”
          review.

          Per Rotten Tomatoes definition, both Frostbite and Blue Harvest would
          receive a rotten Tomatometer score of 0%, while Prime Directive and
          Artemis both receive a fresh score of 100%. Do you feel misled?

          This is where Patched Tomatoes comes in. I find that simply looking at
          a film&apos;s average rating is much more interesting. Let&apos;s
          convert the critic ratings to percentages and calculate their average:
        </p>
        <table
          cellPadding="4"
          cellSpacing="0"
          style={{ textAlign: "left", width: "100%" }}

          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Film</th>
              <th>Emma</th>
              <th>Liam</th>
              <th>Olivia</th>
              <th>Noah</th>
              <th>Ava</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Frostbite</td>
              <td>45%</td>
              <td>50%</td>
              <td>45%</td>
              <td>50%</td>
              <td>50%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Blue Harvest</td>
              <td>10%</td>
              <td>20%</td>
              <td>15%</td>
              <td>20%</td>
              <td>10%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Prime Directive</td>
              <td>90%</td>
              <td>100%</td>
              <td>95%</td>
              <td>90%</td>
              <td>90%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Artemis</td>
              <td>55%</td>
              <td>60%</td>
              <td>55%</td>
              <td>60%</td>
              <td>60%</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>These average out to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frostbite: 48%</li>
          <li>Blue Harvest: 15%</li>
          <li>Prime Directive: 93%</li>
          <li>Artemis: 58%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Perhaps Artemis isn&apos;t the critically-acclaimed film Rotten
          Tomatoes indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          One side effect of this is that it&apos;s a lot harder for a film to
          get a 100% rating. In fact, the only way for this to happen would be
          if every single critic agreed that it was a perfect film - and this
          has never happened. The current highest-ranking films are Citizen Kane
          and The Wizard of Oz at ~94%.
        </p>
        <p>
          I posit that it&apos;s all the more impressive for a modern film to
          reach this level of consensus given the sheer number of critics rating
          films online today. Which number tells you more, that Parasite (with
          356 total reviews) received a Tomatometer rating of 99%, or that
          Parasite&apos;s average rating is 93.7%?
